The file /studiot-3d-bg/studiot-3d-bg/src/assets/models/corn.glb is a binary file that contains the 3D model data in GLTF format. As such, it cannot be represented as text content. You will need to create or obtain a GLTF model file named "corn.glb" and place it in the specified directory.

If you need help creating a GLTF model or finding one, please let me know!
